This project is to support the Global Urban Displacement Project's work on mapping gentrification and displacement. The repository contains different code workbooks that combine all of the calculations and methodologies used to produce the report for the 2020 Urban Displacement Studio for Sydney Australia. We hope that researchers and students will find the code offered here a to adequately answer the questions they may have regarding how we came to the conclusions we did during our research. By clicking into the Sydney folder, you will be taken into the page that contains the analyses for Twitter, AirBnB, and ABS Census Data.
