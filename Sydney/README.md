# Sydney Analysis Structure

* **Demographics** - This folder contains the descriptive statistics and indicator variable generation for the Sydney Gentrification and Displacement typology. Each notebook is compiled in a way that identifies the Australian Bureau of Statistics tables used for the calculations and the typology which it builds towards.

* **Twitter** - This folder contains the Twitter home-location analyses that were developed by Ate Poorthuis Ph.D. at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. The design of this work was to utilize geotagged tweets in the Sydney Urban Centre and Locality (UCL) to get an idea of who were the types of people that would tweet within a particular SA2 boundary to see if there was any disparity between who publicized living there and who actually lived there.

* **AirBnB** - In a paper published by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI), titled "Technological disruption in private housing
markets: the case of Airbnb", the Sydney group wanted to analyze the spatial distribution of AirBnB listings. InsideAirBnB, a website dedicated to scraping AirBnB data to track its growth alongside housing policy decisions, provided a dataset that contained the total number of listings available in November of 2019. The analysis here helped inform the group of the total number of housing units that are taken off the market due to their short-term rental status.
